Description
===========

Model deployments are a managed resource in the OCI Data Science
service to use to deploy machine learning models as HTTP endpoints in
OCI. Deploying machine learning models as web applications (HTTP CLI
endpoints) serving predictions in real time is the most common way
that models are productionized. HTTP endpoints are flexible and can
serve requests for model predictions.
